classdef tfeLCMDirection < tfeQCM
% tfeLCMDirection
%  Create at tfeLCMDirection (Linear Channels Model) object
%
% Syntax:
%    tfe = tfeLCMDirection(varargin);
% 
% Description:
%     Implements a model where the response is a linear sum of angularly tuned
%     mechanisms, uses this to compute equivalent contrast, and then applies
%     Naka-Rushton function.  This is a generalization of the forward model
%     introduced by Brouwer and Heeger (2009, J. Neuro.,
%     29(44):13992â€“14003).
%
%     Stimulus specified as unit vector direction and contrast, and are
%     assumed to be bipolor modulations, so that we symmetrerize channel
%     sensitivities and weights.
%
%     Inherits optional key/value pairs from parent class tfeQCM, plus
%     those specified below.
%
% Inputs:
%    None.
%
% Outputs:
%    obj         - The object.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    'dimension' - The dimension of the stimuli. Can be 2 or 3. Default
%                  3, but this only works if it is set to 2. (Not entirely
%                  clear how to build the channesl in a 3D angular space.)
